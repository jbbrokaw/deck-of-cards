deck-of-cards
=============

* Has basic (sensibly comparable) cards of class Card()
* Deck inherits list (to get nice iterability, etc.), contains cards
* deal() gives top card (and puts it "at the bottom")
* Shuffle uses random module to shuffle the deck in place
* Pretty good unit tests, I think.
